# Polarization_noIV
polarization project with no IV

Project Created on July 2nd, 2016
To run the regressions with no IV's
Bartik form variables are treated as exogeneous, tariff changes are used as independent variables directy rather than IVs.

Initial code 1: regressionsYawen_15Oct28.do
This code was used to generate the results in my JMP, where tariff changes are used as IVs.

Initial code 2: Bartik_15Oct26.do
Generate regional trade shocks using bartik format.

Initial code 3: Delta_15Oct26.do
Compute the regional "delta_omega" (share of tasks being used by foreign countries )
